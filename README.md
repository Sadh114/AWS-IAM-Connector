AWS IAM Permissions Viewer 
</br>
Project Overview : 
</br>
This project has a python tool that connects to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to fetch and display user permissions, including attached managed policies, inline policies, and group memberships, helping users audit and visualize access controls securely.

Built with boto3 for AWS API integration, it offers a CLI script for console output/CSV export and a  web app for interactive browser-based viewing, all compatible with AWS Free Tier for no-cost IAM reads.
